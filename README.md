âœ¨ My spin on the Instagram feed, brought to life with smooth animations and slick UI.
This is my take on the Instagram UI. It was a fun project to recreate some of my favorite features, focusing on clean design and cool interactions.


What's inside:
Core Stuff
Posting: You can write captions and add images from a URL (or get a random one).

Liking: Click the heart or double-tap an image to like a post.

Commenting: Real-time comment system under each post.

Stories: A scrolling story bar at the top with animated borders.

The Fun Stuff
Smooth Animations: Everything from posts sliding in to hearts beating on like.

Cool Design: It's got a purple-pink gradient theme and some slick "frosted glass" effects on the menus.

Responsive: Looks good on mobile and desktop.

How to use it:
Post: Type in the main text field and click "Share Post".

Add a Photo: Click "Add Photo", then enter a URL. Leave it blank for a random pic.

Like: Click the heart or double-click the image.

Comment: Type in the comment field and hit Enter.

Stories: Click a story to see the demo alert.

Thanks for checking it out!
